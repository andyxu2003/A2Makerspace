      well there are two really interesting components to this study number one
      is that we are studying a process in which cells convert to a metastatic
      phenotype very much like melanoma in the absence of DNA damage exposure to
      carcinogens or any kind of oncogenes expression so this is a this is an
      example of the initiation of a cancer like process without any of those
      types of damage that are usually thought to be required for cancer so by
      itself this is a really interesting aspect of the carcinogenic process
      that is induced by a physiological change not not a genetic defect the
      other interesting thing about this study is that we use the machine
      learning platform here to get a better picture of what's going on inside
      the animal of how this whole system works so that is basically the most
      creative part of the scientific enterprise is is when scientists try to
      think about what the data mean and how to combine them to form a good
      model of what the biological system is doing so that they could then make
      make changes in the system behavior and and I think what we what we're
      showing here is that artificial intelligence and machine learning really
      have an important part to play not just in the sort of drudgery of
      calculations but actually in the most creative aspects of the scientific
      enterprise well when we embarked on the project we had great faith that
      this kind of machine learning technology can be used to answer questions
      like this and so in a certain in a certain sense we expected this this to
      work broadly however realistically when we when we actually saw this
      identify this this treatment of three specific chemicals that we could use
      and when we actually tried them and it worked in the lab you know it right
      in front of our eyes we were it was it was really quite quite shocking I
      mean it's one thing to sort of think that that the the general approach is
      going to work but it's quite another to have an artificial intelligence
      look at your data come up with it's its own representation of what is
      going on in the biological system and then make recommendations for
      achieving an outcome that you've never seen before and then have that be
      confirmed in the lab and and that that was pretty striking to us well
      we're interested in both aspects of this problem so we're certainly
      interested in how cells make decisions in the body whether those decisions
      lead to cells forming specific organs during embryogenesis or whether they
      go awry and convert to a carcinogenic or metastatic phenotype so we're
      certainly interested in understanding cancer for both the biomedical
      applications and because it's it's a window and the most basic biological
      facts of how cells communicate and carry out their business at the same
      time we're also very interested in how artificial intelligence can help
      scientists to understand complex living systems it's it's a reality that
      would the amount of research that's going on every day the amount of data
      and information available to us is growing constantly and it's it's
      rapidly outstripping the ability of human scientists to keep everything in
      their mind to be able to sort of glean insight from the mountain of raw
      data that we're getting so so I think what we need is a new bioinformatics
      of shape you know what what computers did for bioinformatics of protein
      and and gene sequencing we need to do the same thing for the more complex
      functions of cell behavior and artificial intelligence is a tool that we
      really have to use to continue to make progress in regenerative medicine
      well regenerative medicine and cancer medicine are both facing the same
      problem which is that basic scientists continuously identify more and more
      complex pathways and various factors that go into these decisions that
      cells have to make and so in order to develop effective therapeutics we
      have to really understand what the system is doing and then be able to
      infer specific treatments or interventions that are going to get the cells
      to do what we want them to do and this is becoming increasingly more
      difficult the more we understand how cells are controlled and the more
      data that we actually have so I think the implications for these fields
      are that what this kind of technology will allow us to do is to use the
      special skills of these kinds of AI systems to help design interventions
      to help design treatments that will have specific outcomes in terms of
      cell behavior in terms of patterning in terms of regenerative growth and
      repair and so on the name of the game is to come up with interventions
      that cause specific therapeutic outcomes and this will be an invaluable
      tool for us to be able to identify and and and determine what those
      interventions need to be
