      experiences in the conversation to come please extend a warm welcome to
      Professor Peter Wynne and the Honorable Sonia Sotomayor Associate Justice
      of the United States Supreme Court hi hello way back when I know I didn't
      ever imagine this I doubt you did - no I don't think so but I'm delighted
      that it is happening and I want to add my personal gain Vinita - you're
      welcome to Tufts - yes in yin and - thank you on what I know is an
      extraordinarily busy day and a busy schedule taking the time to come here
      to have this conversation with me and with the Tufts community which you
      can see it turns out into force to take advantage of that opportunity
      thank you for being here all of you I got driven over here you had a walk
      and when we first met you were asking questions and I was trying to come
      up with answers and now I think perhaps our positions are reversed so let
      me go to my first question when we first met you were Sonia not yet
      justice Sotomayor a young woman from a modest family from New York latina
      who is trying to first understand and then adapt and finally succeed in
      the very different elite Anglo environment at Princeton what did you learn
      from that experience which help you succeed not only at Princeton but also
      at Yale Law School within the judiciary and which might help many of the
      students here succeed on their own there's a little part of me that would
      love to go back and do a do-over with college you have the chance to avoid
      I don't want to call the mistakes but I want to call them the the learning
      the bumps of learning lessons as I went through Princeton but I think my
      undergraduate career was the seminal point in my life in transforming me
      into a person who was capable of succeeding and that's the value of an
      undergraduate education it's called the liberal arts education for a
      purpose and its purpose is to ensure that when you leave here you are and
      should be in essence and it's a lesson I learned as in Princeton you
      should be a well-rounded human being and that means I worry that in
      today's drive to have majors and minors see all these resumes with kids
      who go to college two majors two minors I don't know what else you do that
      sounds like Tufts yeah that you forget that this is the place for you to
      explore topics you know nothing about this is the place for you to learn
      about the world around you and not necessarily use that knowledge in a
      profession but just to give you a base in which you become believe it or
      not a more interesting person the more well-rounded you are the better
      you're going to perform in your profession regardless of what the
      profession is whether it's computer sciences regular sciences medicine
      engineering if you know what is in the world around you you're gonna do
      your job better they built the courthouse in the Southern District of New
      York and I went in for my first court appearance and the robing room had
      no closet for the road failure of I think you become so specialized that
      you forget about the world when you're here take topics and things you
      know nothing about take a religion course just to learn about the
      religions that are causing Wars well world world wars take a philosophy
      course take an economics courses so so so so so so them sociology
      psychology and then specialize later in what you're doing but become first
      a well-rounded person and I think that's what happened to me I was so
      scared at Princeton that I took just basic courses and I wasn't sure what
      I wanted to study so I took all those courses trying to figure out where I
      was going to end up so my good fortune I ended up in the history
      department and hence with professor with but I didn't start out knowing
      what I was going to do second you are in a place where there are people
      from across the United States and probably people from around the world
      you have an opportunity to meet people who live lives differently than you
      do befriend them don't stay clustered in your own background open the
      world to yourself by making friends with people who are different than you
      are and I certainly think that that has helped me enormous Lee in my
      career because in each place that I've been I've used my ethnic group as a
      security blanket as my anchor to you know it gave me a sense of
      familiarity and of comfort and security to be with some people who were
      closer to what I was and to my experiences but I always made a conscious
      decision to go out and befriend other people that were different than me
      and now I travel the United States on book tours and otherwise and there's
      always people that I know from college everywhere I know and they're not
      all Latinos they're from every background a man janabu and they have
      supported me throughout my ventures in my life third and I think this is
      critically important and perhaps the most important thing use this as your
      laboratory for experimenting with yourself and by that I mean I in my book
      my beloved world describe the difficulties I had with writing and college
      was the perfect environment for me to tackle that problem you have
      professors graduate students or assistant professors full professors who
      are devoted to you as undergraduates and if you do the thing that I have
      found most helpful even to this day just ask questions when you don't know
      ask someone to explain it to you it's almost as simple as that I didn't
      know how to write and I went to you and said can you help me figure out
      how to do it better and you did now it's possible somebody will say no
      anything's possible in life but that means you just go to somebody else
      you just don't get discouraged and how many of you have been in a
      classroom where there professor has been talking and you don't understand
      what they're saying and finally somebody raises their hand and says I'm
      not quite sure and all the heads go like this I'm not sure I that there's
      no reason for that but as some of you may know I am known to be a great
      questioner at oral argument I got that from my undergraduate experience
      you should too because if you go around life with curiosity people will
      see it they'll respond to you they'll engage with you and they will teach
      you things that will help you and so for me those probably were the
      greatest lessons of my undergraduate life many many more by the way that's
      true when the well-rounded tough student comes to pursue the profession I
      know from my conversations people who are in this room that many of them
      are thinking of a legal career inspired by your example and maybe even
      dreaming of someday becoming a judge or Supreme Court justice themselves
      what would be your advice to them see if I so give every student live your
      life with passion every single thing you do every course you take every
      student activity you engage in it's not quantity that counts it's quality
      maximize what you take out of every experience you have and especially for
      law school doesn't matter what undergraduate course you take they don't
      care law schools they want to know that you get good grades and they want
      to see that you're a leader and to see that they don't want to see you
      belonging to 50 different organizations and they're plenty of students who
      list 50 different organizations what they're really looking for is where
      have you shown real leadership where have you done initiatives or taking
      charge of new things Peter remembers because I involved him I started of
      course not started but did a course with Peter I wanted to learn about my
      background and I knew nothing about my Puerto Rican history and I asked
      him and with his guidance we put together a course that's a tiny example
      of leadership but law schools and everybody's interested in that how many
      doctors potential asked us Peru what am I having I must be tired today
      sure how many are here aspiring to be doctors and how many of you who are
      should know that medical schools are very worried about the fact that so
      many doctors don't know how to relate to their patients they're so stuck
      in their sciences and medicine that they haven't learned to be social
      creatures and many medical schools are now admitting students who haven't
      done their traditional curriculum but who have shown those same qualities
      on talking about leadership and admitting them to medical school and as
      with law school you have to have good grades and you have to be at the top
      of your class and all of that other stuff but they have recognized that
      what I said at the beginning being a well-rounded person in every field
      takes you further and so if you have aspirations of doing anything take
      advantage of every moment that you're exposed to something new squeeze out
      of it every bit of information you can every bit of knowledge you can and
      engage in the world around you and get to know the world be curious about
      it constantly learn about things you know nothing about just for the sake
      of learning you'd be surprised when those things become a value I spent
      three weeks on the district court learning about the mosquito repellent
      Johnson & Johnson was soo soothing soothe a suing Avon for false
      advertisement related to its skin skin so soft now what did I need to know
      about mosquito repellent not much but when I went to Africa I knew what to
      buy well speaking of inspiration I'm struck by how you have inspired so
      many young people from such diverse backgrounds like the preteen daughter
      of a friend who has read and reread the young adult version of your
      autobiography many times and last Halloween decided to dress up as justice
      Sotomayor how how do you explain this ability you have to inspire and to
      get through and to mobilize for for good effects and good things so many
      young people from such diverse backgrounds the reason I wrote my memoir
      one of many but a really critical reason and I described it in the preface
      to my book my memoir is my beloved world by the way and I know some of the
      students have told me they've read it was because I know that there's so
      many people out there like me who have lived in difficult and challenging
      circumstances who really hunger to know that despite all of that happy
      endings are possible Peter as you know I was diagnosed with diabetes when
      I was seven and a half my family was you graciously called it modest but
      we lived in public housing in the Bronx subsidized public housing my
      father died when I was nine we were poor and we struggled and I struggled
      with my dad's alcoholism and with so many other things and that I can show
      people that despite all of those challenges I can make it the answer is so
      can you I am truly no different than any one of you I have the same human
      flaws I have the same insecurities I have the same means and I have the
      same difficulties whether it was learning how to write English at properly
      or to learn how to speak English properly all of those things take effort
      but they can be done and so it's the reason I decided to write my memoir
      in the hopes that it would inspire people who might find it otherwise
      difficult to believe that it's possible the Lancer speak but speaking
      about diversity let's talk about your new book ah and when I learned that
      you were writing a children's book about diversity I assumed he was about
      ethnic diversity that it was going to take off from being a Latina growing
      up in the Bronx and and and go from there drawing on your experience but
      it is a very different book than I imagined them I don't know if you can
      talk about bodily diversity well or or diversity of disabilities but also
      the benefits they come from that exactly so this is just as just came out
      it's 12 children each of them with different childhood challenges some
      physical some not so it goes from me being a kid if you can't see it's a
      beautiful book sitting in a flower giving myself a shot of medicine and I
      have children in the book with the most what were to be the most common
      childhood conditions from allergies to asthma to dyslexia to hyperactivity
      to blindness and deafness to being in a wheelchair to Down syndrome
      there's 12 different conditions and the message of the book is if you see
      a child doing something different you see anybody doing thing different
      don't assume the worst in them why don't you just ask them why and the
      story and the message was born from an incident that happened to me in my
      30s for most of my young adulthood I was ashamed of my diabetes and I hid
      it I rarely told my friends that I had it my roommates yes because I had
      syringes and vials in the room but not the other people who were even
      important in my life and if at a restaurant I would order my food and then
      excuse myself to go to the restroom to hide that I was giving myself my
      insulin well this particular night in a restaurant the stall was empty and
      I went in and did it outside and as I was finishing a woman walked in and
      I was putting away the syringe I walked out I sat down finished dinner
      started to walk out and I walked past her table and hear her whisper she's
      a drug addict and I stopped and I'm filled with shame mortified and then a
      little bit of controlled anger stepped in and I walked back and I said
      madam I'm not a drug addict I'm a diabetic and you saw me taking my
      insulin and it's medicine that saves my life every day don't presume the
      worst in people when you see them doing something different just ask them
      why 30 years later great one my last question is a very tough question
      Tufts prides itself on being an institution that promotes active
      citizenship I know in your lifetime you've also promoted active
      citizenship and been an example what advice would you give to young people
      who want to spend their adult lives making this world a better place one
      person is not gonna fix all the problems in the world and if that's your
      goal you're gonna fail miserably what you have to do is find the problem
      or set of problems that interest you in particular that raised that
      passion that I was talking about and it could be in anything because small
      steps are important to change the world it's all of us working together
      every single day and each of us working as a collective to make the
      various and so many problems that we have better and so my answer is don't
      be a bystander in life don't let things happen to you in the law laws are
      made by men and women and if you don't like them get up and change them
      you start in the voting booth but you also start in the lobbying and the
      talking and the writing about issues that are important to you if it's
      something to do with the quality of education join your school board and
      get involved if it has to do with medical care then volunteer at a
      hospital and work on making better their access to their population all
      problems require solutions and only people can affect those solutions and
      so for me my advice to become an involved citizen is and I use that word
      loosely I use citizen not in the official national belonging or you're a
      citizen of the US I'm talking about it being a citizen of your community
      and whether you're involved in ensuring that you're giving it a piece of
      yourself now some people are leaders in change and others are followers
      doesn't matter which one you are followers help get things done they let
      the visionaries sort of take the lead that's okay without you it doesn't
      get done either so please when you're living your life now identify the
      things that excite you and go out and change the world because you will be
      a much happier place and the world will be a much better place because
      you're a part of it and you're working at it so for me as you can tell I'm
      passionate about this I'm passionate about civic education in schools not
      only because I want you to learn about the government but I want you to
      learn about your voice in this government it's there but you have to be
      you have to make it be heard thank you sure I'm getting up now because I
      don't like sitting down and I like walking around and what's going to
      happen now is it's time for student questions that have been vetted and
      pre-selected but from those that were submitted now the there's a lot of
      men and women around the room with little things in their ears they're my
      Marshalls they're here to protect me from myself they don't like I walk
      around you but the deal is you can't get up unexpectedly or they get
      scared so I'll walk around I'll shake your hand I may even grab a hug from
      some of you but you stay seated okay okay now I want the questionnaires to
      identify themselves and then ask their questions Karolina the first
      question I i'm karolina mccabe and I'm a first year planning on studying
      civic studies and international relations now you already know I like what
      you're studying well having outstanding academic and judicial credentials
      you also bring a rich and diverse background to the Supreme Court as the
      first Hispanic on the court as well as experiences you mentioned dealing
      with diabetes from young age being raised by widowed mother facing
      financial challenges and discrimination how do you think those diverse
      experiences have impacted your perspective during your legal career and as
      a justice on the Supreme Court and do you think that greater diversity in
      federal and state court system is important all right I guess they do I'll
      answer your last question yes I think it's very important to have
      diversity on the Supreme Court but not the kind that most of you are
      thinking about I don't think it's as important although very important to
      have gender racial and ethnic diversity on the court we're not religiously
      diverse enough yet we have one Protestant three Jews and the rest are
      Catholics myself included okay I am more worried about the lack of
      experience diversity on the Supreme Court we have no justice with criminal
      law experience we have no justice with environmental experience we have
      only one civil rights lawyer Ruth Bader Ginsburg all right now women's
      issues are critical don't minimize it but we have so many different civil
      rights questions today not just special needs to me the court needs those
      perspectives not because they are going to control the outcome of any case
      or any issue but because the different perspectives enrich the
      conversation we have when people can bring in their life experiences and
      at least explain an argument even if the others don't accept it then at
      least you know that everybody's perspective has been aired in the room now
      you ask me how all of my different experiences influence my decisions I
      have no idea some are contradictory I was a state prosecutor and in
      private practice I represented basically the fortune 500 companies of
      Europe and I defended them most of the time all right I went to Catholic
      school not public school I was raised by a single mother not of why dad
      wasn't around who's who could tell how anyone experienced influences any
      one judgment I make I'm a mom of all of my life experiences just like
      every one of you are you're not a person who wears glasses alone you're
      not a person who likes blue you're a whole human being and every
      experience gives you a different perspective and a different feeling about
      his things and so for me I don't value diversity for the sake of diversity
      I value it for its contributions to the conversation we are making the
      most important legal decisions that affect your lives every single day if
      you don't believe law affects you every day please remember when you
      stopped at the red light why are you doing it because the law says you
      have to smart law but there are so many other laws that control your lives
      in ways you don't consciously perceive but which are affecting you
      directly you want the people involved in interpreting the laws that are
      passed to have as many different life perspectives as possible in the
      hopes that we won't miss something important and by the way that doesn't
      mean we're infallible as many of you know I dissent a lot so but it gives
      us a better shot when there's diversity Peter for the next question by the
      way come over here follow me where is my lovely photographer right behind
      me come on like take a picture with the students who have your question
      where are you I'm here oh thank you what's the second question the second
      question is from Robin oh it was you I went for the picture come on back
      to go ahead ask your questions for you what I'm listening what advice do
      you have for students specifically women of color that are looking to go
      into public service but often feel overshadowed or ignored in these spaces
      well I'm trying to say this in a nice way and maybe there isn't when I was
      in law school one of my friends said to me I love you Sonia because you
      argue like a man and I looked at him and I said Rudy should I punch you
      out what in the world made you say something so stupid and he looked at me
      and he said well you know women when they ask a question in the classroom
      will always say to the professor professor have you thought of this or I
      don't know if this makes any sense or maybe I could be wrong it's
      qualified right he says a man always just jumps in and says oh you're
      saying that but I don't think that's right listen to your next classroom
      discussion and that's what you're going to hear well I think we do feel
      not hurt and I think we feel not heard because we don't make ourselves be
      heard because we are tentative in our presentations because we often are
      unsure of ourselves and don't know how to take command of a room I'm a
      Supreme Court justice but you're listening to me because my voice projects
      doesn't it because I modulated I'm not monotone because I have a presence
      in which I show you hey listen to me I'm I do intimidate some lawyers my
      point is when you are going to be in a room you have to be thoroughly
      prepared you have to be confident of yourself even if you're not and
      sometimes you just have to practice being confident you have to sit there
      and force them to listen by the persuasiveness of your argument and by its
      clarity and so it's not I said I wasn't sure you were gonna like the
      answer and even with all of that I can't convince some of those guys to
      vote my way a lot of times so it's not like it's always gonna work but I
      think we have a better chance when we believe in ourselves and believe
      that we have something important to say that confidence is 90% of what
      convinces people that others are right how many of you have been in the
      room with the real bully who by emphatic statement pushes people to do
      things I don't want to be that person but notice the trait that makes
      people respond next next questions Jose where are you Jose ask your
      question first and then follow me okay the mosque you see the Syrian
      Vanitas you make me really proud of being Latino so I'm really happy for
      you to be here thank you my name is Jose Martinez probably a Poli Sci
      major but we'll see and so my question is what were the emotions and
      thoughts that went through your head when you were selected as the first
      Latina justice did you feel like you were changing the norms in a certain
      way of what a Supreme Court justice looks like for young kids like me no
      come around that way I was scared witless of going to the Supreme Court no
      social media and during the nomination process there were certain articles
      that said I wasn't smart enough and there were certain anonymous people
      who were complaining that I wasn't very nice in the court now all of my
      colleagues on the second circuit came out publicly and said the
      allegations were not true but they hurt and they hurt deeply because I had
      spent a lifetime I thought building up a positive reputation and I
      actually paused and thought to myself should I be doing this and I
      actually considered pulling out of the nomination process and I talked to
      one friend who then talked to other friends I've forgiven her but it took
      me a while to do that and one of those people came up to me and said stop
      feeling sorry for yourself this is just not about you it's about and her
      daughter was eight years old it's about my eight-year-old daughter and her
      being able to see someone like us in a position of power and I realized
      that she was right I had made it about me and I realized not only that
      that was selfish because when you do things for yourself you lose sight of
      the value of what you're doing and so at that moment I stayed in and you
      know what happens and where I am but I do understand it's part of the
      question the Peter asked earlier that those in the public thank you do
      take heart from seeing me there now I forewarn you one of these days I'm
      gonna write an opinion you don't like if I spend a lifetime not doing that
      that I'm doing something wrong as a judge because I don't write opinions
      based on what I think the answer should be I write opinions on mind what I
      think the law says they should be and so remember something one of the
      things that happens to everyone is that idols including your parents
      eventually become human don't they and most children at some point get
      upset when they realize mommy and daddy have flaws well the same thing
      with the idols you have made I'm a human being I'm here to show you how
      human I am I make mistakes and so does the court we are fallible even
      though the saying is we're not right because right and we're not
      infallible because we're right we're right because they tell us we can be
      right we're the last word in a lot of things but for me I understand that
      and I beg those who get to know me to remember always I am a human being
      just like you and I'm not perfect neither are you none of us are but we
      can still try to do our very best and we can still try to help in every
      way we can knowing that we're imperfect thank you now the question that
      cuts the other way from the court to the community leaving it asked the
      question my name is Lydia yeses and I'm a sophomore studying political
      science and civic studies so throughout your incredible career you have
      been an outspoken judge and justice now how have you continued to stay
      continue to stay connected to your community roots and values even when
      it's not easy you know something you I'm here right I'm here because we
      live a rather monastic experience I got this beautiful office in
      Washington DC I've got seven people who work for me directly a whole
      courthouse that indirectly helps my office and the other eight people the
      other eight justices have the same thing and we have all have our little
      fiefdom system our little places where we spend day in and day out and day
      in and day out it can get monastic and isolating and I know that it's one
      of the reasons I've chosen to speak to groups that a lot of my colleagues
      don't traditionally speak to so I come to colleges but I also go to high
      schools I've gone to grammar schools both middle school and primary
      schools I've set with a head start program a bunch of kids and one little
      boy was sitting there with me and we're playing together and he reaches
      behind him to get something and he sees my picture which was on the side
      of his cabinet and he looks at the picture and looks at me looks at the
      picture looks at me and then says you're her he had no idea who I was they
      had talked to him about me but I was a figure that teachers talked about
      you know that reminded me of being human and so for me my outreach is to
      the larger community because I do want to stay grounded and I do want to
      stay a part of all of you because if I'm going to render rulings or
      participate in rendering rulings that are going to affect you I want to
      know how and so I do spend a lot of time and that includes in a lot of
      different communities just not in the Latino community in isolation I do
      you know I go to Puerto Rico every year I do stuff there I certainly do
      some things that are related to my culture and to my life within my
      culture you know I went to Puerto Rico and so lin-manuel Hamilton you know
      that was pretty cool okay so and and you know I I go to bilingual programs
      I do all sorts of things all of my books all four of my books are
      immediately translated from English to Spanish and published on the same
      day that is so so rare because I want to ensure the kids like me who
      didn't speak English first can have access to materials that other kids
      are reading and so that's why I do okay but you asked me how you have to
      make the effort it doesn't just happen on its own you have to take the
      time and I've always said to people who are busy and that's all of you
      you're all in college it's so easy when you're in college maybe to
      consider maybe I won't go home for this holiday you know I got something
      more fun to do or I want to study something well those holidays are really
      important to your families and those times are memories that will carry
      you in your old age when they're not around anymore you know the holidays
      that I went back and spent with my grandmother she's gone now I can't do
      that anymore but I still carry them here and every Christmas Eve the day
      she died I was with her I had come home from college and didn't leave the
      hospital for three days and she died on the third I'll never regret doing
      that you have to make time for the people you love and you have to
      sometimes balance the competitions in your life and decide priorities I
      know from me that I've learned very important lessons in life death
      illness weddings disparate things right they're the three most important
      things in people's lives if you're a family member or you're a friend and
      your presence at those three things you will be loved forever because that
      defines people's understanding of you caring enough to make time for them
      when life is either the most joyous or the most difficult and so that's
      how I do I work like the dickens some of you may know I issued a dissent
      yesterday in a case there's a two hour difference between here and well I
      was three hours when this started and then two hours and yesterday an hour
      behind and throughout the day I was talking to my office and my poor law
      clerks were working through the night as I finished up my stuff and went
      back and worked with them over the phone so you can make time it just may
      cost you a little sleep for our last question takes us back to the court
      and seems particularly relevant to the court Peter hello Peter how are you
      thank you so my name is Peter smiley I'm a first year planning on studying
      CS and computer science at Tufts and I was wondering how you manage
      relationships and interact with other Supreme Court justices you might
      have differing political views the one thing I know about every single
      justice myself included is that every one of us shares one passion the
      court every one of us is devoted to that institution and what it
      represents in our system of government we all revere the Constitution we
      all believe in our Republican form of government we all care equally
      deeply about doing the best job we can to uphold those values we may
      differ in how we believe and what we believe is the best answer to do that
      but I don't mistake our differences as reflecting ill-will on their part
      it is a real conversation that we have and our differences are there to
      show us that there are no clear answers that we have to really work at
      coming up with right answers it is I fear too easy for people to fail to
      listen when what they're hearing is different than what they think the
      impulse is to think the other person's mistaken it's much harder to keep
      an open mind and respectfully listen to each other and most of the time
      when we do we can identify the chasm the fault line that separates us and
      it's much more easy when you can do that out of respect then when you
      assume that because someone disagrees with you they're bad people they're
      not they have reasons for why they disagree sometimes the reasons may not
      seem compelling to you because you value something else more but if you
      deal with people out of respect you can disagree agreeably I do believe
      that today our politicians have forgotten how to do that and it's my
      prayer like I think the rest of you that they figure out a way to do that
      but I think that you guys should set the example good luck to you Sonia I
      want to thank you not only for being here but for your incredibly
      thoughtful answers to our questions you've given us much food for thought
      as individuals as in terms of us in people's studies and in terms of their
      lives and for all that on behalf of everyone here from the Tufts community
      thank you thank you everybody
