      <h1> Daniel Dennett Interview Transcript</h1>
        I think it's absolutely possible that we can have conscious robots,
        conscious AIs. I don't think it's desirable. I think we can learn what
        we wanna learn, which is a lot about the nature of human consciousness
        with simpler models, smart tools, yes, but we don't need artificial
        colleagues, because if we really succeeded, then they would be precisely
        as autonomous as we are, and we're very dangerous. And unless we could
        be sure that they would have the same opportunities for learning how to
        behave, and what to value in culture, it would be reckless for us to
        give them that much autonomy. Given that I'm pessimistic about the
        safety of conscious AIs, I'm also optimistic about the difficulty of
        getting it. I don't think we're anywhere close. I don't think it's
        coming in 10 years, or 20 years, or 50 years, and I don't think that the
        wonderful successes of deep learning, machine learning, the latest wave
        of enthusiasm in AI, that's giving us some great fabrics, but it's not
        giving us the architectures of conscious agency. Time and memory are the
        basis of agency, of human life. Learning depends on being able to
        extract information from your past and apply it in the future. All of
        life is a matter of exploiting the past to anticipate the presence of
        the future, and the sense of the passage of time is a byproduct of our
        agency, of the fact that we're evolved to take care of ourselves, to
        fend off the inexorable demands of the second law of thermodynamics that
        say that we're gonna get ground down to dust eventually. So time matters
        for us a way it doesn't matter for planets, or mountains, or the ocean.
        It matters for living things 'cause their time is limited. Well, one of
        the hardest lessons to accept is that people that don't agree with you
        are not flaming idiots. There's something behind what they think that if
        you don't understand, you're not going to be able to communicate.
        However gratifying, however satisfying it may be to your sense of
        righteousness and order, you can't beat people over the head with a
        logic stick and get them to change their minds. You have to meet them on
        their own ground, and it's hard work, and it often doesn't work, but we
        just have to keep trying. Belief is not a voluntary act. If I offered
        you a hundred dollars to believe that snow was blue, you couldn't. No
        way to collect that money. You could pretend. Beliefs are established by
        our experience, and by our interaction with the world, and they can be
        very hard to dislodge, and it takes a lot of effort to examine and
        reconsider, and particularly to abandon opinions, convictions that
        you've had when you learn that there's alternatives. And I think that
        one of the hardest tasks a human mind can face is reserving judgment
        about a conviction that has always seemed to you obvious, and thinking
        about how maybe that might not be right. Well, I think one of the things
        that I've learned, and have made it a big part of my practice as a
        philosopher, is you almost never see somebody change their mind because
        they've been given a formal argument with premises and a logical
        conclusion, and it's been just beaten into them. You know, accept this
        conclusion or die. That doesn't work. You have to enliven the
        imagination. You have to sometimes even trick, cajole, seduce people
        into seeing things in a different way, inverting their view in some way.
        I think philosophy is not so much of science as an art, and it's the art
        of imagination instruction, in a way. I think one of the things I've
        learned is that when somebody in a class or in an audience says, "This
        may be a dumb question," but it's usually the best question. The experts
        seldom ask really surprising questions. The undergraduates are great at
        asking good questions. In fact, one of my sort of maxims over the years
        is that if you're not teaching undergraduates in philosophy, you're
        going to get inbred and artifactual. Undergraduates, bold as brass, they
        ask the good questions. And if you can't explain what you're doing to
        bright undergraduates, then you don't know what you're doing.
